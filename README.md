# Spotify-to-Google-Music
Just a small little app to automate music library migration. Pulls all songs from your Spotify library and mirrors it to your Google Play library.

### Installing
Requires [https://github.com/plamere/spotipy](Spotipy) and [gmusicapi](https://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Usage
1. Fill in all login credentials and tokens as required in [tokens.py](https://github.com/0600Hours/Spotify-to-Google-Music/blob/master/tokens.py)
2. Run main.py
3. Follow the spotipy setup information
4. Watch as your songs get mirrored

Note: Due to limitations of the gmusicapi library, not all songs will be able to be successfully mirrored.
